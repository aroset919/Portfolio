<h1>Aleena's Top Movie Picks</h1>
<h2>Top 5 Movie Picks as of 2024</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Elementals</h3>
<p>Probably one of the best depictions of romance I have seen in a long while. 
    The characters are unique and relatable; the narrative is well paced;
    and the story flows seamlessly.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>This marks the last of Marvel's great movies outside of the Spiderman franchise.
    Endgame brought an end to an era, and was a perfect culmanation of a story 
    that had been built over multiple intertwining plotlines. 
</p>
<h3>One Piece Film: Red</h3>
<p>I am a huge One Piece fan and this movie was my gateway for a lot of people 
    into the series. Uta was a fantastic addition to the story and the music 
    is still saved on my Spotify playlist.
</p>
<h3>The Super Mario Movie</h3>
<p>This movie was often criticized for lacking a plot, but I adore it becuase 
    of it's commitment to the core of what the Mario franchise is: fun. The 
    Mario games never emphasized story, and yet remained a huge hit. I think 
    the movie reflects that, an experience the viewer is meant to have fun 
    enjoying.
</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Studio Ghibli has been, and will always be, one of the my favorite publishing 
    houses. I credit them and this movie in particular for sparking my interest 
    in anime. Howl's moving castle will always be a childhood favorite of mine.</p>
